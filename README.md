## About the Application

This is an E-Commerce web application where farmers, agriculture land owners and farming enthusiasts can buy agriculture products such as seeds, pesticides and machinery online. Currently the agriculture sector in India has a fragmented supply chain, farmers deal with product uncertainty and are skeptical about buying products online. This web application solves the above problems by transcending mentioned traditional barriers.
